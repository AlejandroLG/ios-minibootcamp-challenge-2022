## The Challenge üöÄ
The purpose of this challenge id for you to demonstrate your iOS skills. 
This is your chance to show off how would you implement the solution of this skills using the patterns you want and the way you prefer. Everything is up to you!

We don‚Äôt want to limit you by providing some fill-in-the-blanks exercises. Instead we want you to develop from your own creativity.

We hope you find this exercise challenging and engaging.

### Challenge 1:
The app loads images from the web and displays them in a UICollectionView, but the behavior of the UI is weird and it‚Äôs freezing üòµ‚Äçüí´

Implement a function to download the images in a smoothly way that allows a good UX when scrolling the UICollectionView.

### Challenge 2:

You can complement that operation with an animation while waiting


## Requirements ‚úÖ

Implement the exercise number 1 & 2 completely.
Keep the use of 3rd party libraries to the minimum.
Please try implementing your own method to download images instead of using a downloader framework. If you use it, justify the use of it on the code.

## Getting Started
We have provided an Xcode project in this repository. 
You can implement your code directly on the codebase. Feel free to add, remove or change anything if you consider it necessary.

Clone the repo in your local, and build & run. It builds and runs without any extra configuration or external dependency.
